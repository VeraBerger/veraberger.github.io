## Messages of Support:

“I have had the privilege of working with Vera the past few years and I am confident in saying that she is a very hard and dedicated worker. She has already implemented huge and positive changes on Pomona’s campus and I know she will only continue to do so in a position like this.” - Andreah Pierre, Senior Class President

"In my time at Pomona, there are few people who have improved life for students as much as Vera. You know, some people run for the clout. A few put up big, flashy campaigns and then proceed to disappear for the rest of the year. But not Vera. They have proven time and time again that they understand the weight of public service—the responsibility and the commitment that it takes to get anything done around here. Vera has the experience and the vision to be a good president. But, importantly, they have the heart to be a great one." Timothy Liu, ASPC North Campus Rep
