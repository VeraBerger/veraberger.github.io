## Messages of Support:

“I have had the privilege of working with Vera the past few years and I am confident in saying that she is a very hard and dedicated worker. She has already implemented huge and positive changes on Pomona’s campus and I know she will only continue to do so in a position like this.” - Andreah Pierre, Senior Class President

"In my time at Pomona, there are few people who have improved life for students as much as Vera. You know, some people run for the clout. A few put up big, flashy campaigns and then proceed to disappear for the rest of the year. But not Vera. They have proven time and time again that they understand the weight of public service—the responsibility and the commitment that it takes to get anything done around here. Vera has the experience and the vision to be a good president. But, importantly, they have the heart to be a great one." Timothy Liu, ASPC North Campus Rep

"No student has worked as closely with the past two ASPC Presidents as I have, and with that I can confidently say that there is no one I trust more to be in this position than Vera. I have been fortunate enough to work with Vera a lot these past couple of years, and they have done beyond incredible work as our current JBoard Chair (removing fines, giving students going through the conduct policy more agency, revamping the entire Student Code), our past Comm. of Facilities & Environment (making care package items eco-friendly, period products in bathrooms, built an amazing working relationship with Bob Robinson which is so much harder than you’d think it is), and a member of the Food Committee (I might chair this committee, but they definitely help run the show). Vera has shown time and time again that they are not only able to successfully implement their goals but pursue projects that benefit the entire student body, both of which are absolutely crucial for this position. I am confident that Vera’s strong leadership skills, good relationships with the administration (not just “working relationships”), and ability to make decisions that take the entire student body into account will drive their success as your next ASPC President." Adeena Liang, VP Finance
